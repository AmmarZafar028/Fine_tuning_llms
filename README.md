Fine tuning a LLM Fine tuning a large language model (LLM) involves adjusting the model's parameters on a specific dataset to improve its performance on tasks relevant to that dataset. This process typically requires a substantial amount of computational resources and expertise in machine learning.

Steps to Fine Tune a LLM Select a Pre-trained Model: Choose a pre-trained LLM that serves as the base for fine-tuning. Common choices include models like GPT-3, BERT, or T5. Prepare the Dataset: Collect and preprocess the dataset that you want to use for fine-tuning. This dataset should be relevant to the tasks you want the model to perform. Set Up the Environment: Ensure you have the necessary libraries and frameworks installed, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with the specific libraries for the LLM you are using (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers). Configure the Training Parameters: Define the hyperparameters for training, such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and any specific configurations required by the model. Fine-tune the Model: Use the training dataset to fine-tune the model. This involves running the training loop where the model learns from the dataset, adjusting its weights based on the loss calculated from its predictions. Evaluate the Model: After fine-tuning, evaluate the model's performance on a validation dataset. This helps to ensure that the model has learned effectively and is not overfitting. Save the Fine-tuned Model: Once satisfied with the model's performance, save the fine-tuned model for future use. This typically involves saving the model architecture and its weights. Deploy the Model: Finally, deploy the fine-tuned model to a production environment where it can be used for inference on new data. Installation Create conda environment:

conda create -n finetune_env python=3.10 -y conda activate finetune_env Install libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt Fine tune model To fine-tune a model, you can use the provided script. Make sure to adjust the parameters according to your dataset and model requirements.

python src/finetune.py After running the script, the fine-tuned model will be saved in the specified directory. You can then use this model for inference or further training.

Example of using the fine-tuned model cd src python inference.py This will load the fine-tuned model and allow you to perform inference tasks. Make sure to adjust the model path in the script if necessary.
